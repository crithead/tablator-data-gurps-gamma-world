To look at the tables, as long as the `tablator` repository is in the parent
directory of the `gurps-gamma-world` repository:

```
./print-all.sh
```

Main raw data file: `data/random-tables.txt`

## TODO

- Add more to `tshirt-type.json`
- Add `condition.json` table and use a subtable where possible

__The Book of Random Tables Post-Apocalyptic__

This book is a resource book for tabletop role-playing games set in a
post-apocalyptic world. Random tables help gamemasters cut prep time by
answering questions right at the table. Post-apocalyptic RPGs often revolve
around the player characters searching for supplies and equipment amid the
ruins. The tables in this book make the GM's job easier.  The first two
tables are for the GM. The Gang Names table is exactly that, helpful names
when you need one in a pinch. The Highway Encounters table gives adventure
ideas and scenarios when running sessions without preparation.  The other
27 tables are for use when the player characters search buildings, cars,
piles of junk, and whatever else they encounter.  After the players receive
a number of search rolls from rolling perception, search or some other skill,
have them roll on the Master Table. Then have them roll on the corresponding
tables.  For example, a player searches a building. A skill roll or the GM
decides to give them four rolls on the Master Table. The player rolls 3,
49, 67, 73. The player then rolls once on each of the Projectile Weapons,
Drugs, Random Items #4, and Random Items #5 tables to determine the items
discovered.  Frankly, these tables can be used in any way that is helpful
for a GM. However, the system explained above is a simple way to get the
most out of these random tables.  It is my sincere hope that this book
will be a faithful companion to GMs and players as they wander the wasteland.
